{"name":"sads","tagline":"R package for fitting species abundance distributions","body":"## Installation\r\n\r\nAvailable on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sads). To install and load current release version in R:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ninstall.packages(sads)\r\nload(sads)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Devel version\r\n\r\nYou can install developer version from GitHub with:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(repo = 'piLaboratory/sads', ref= 'dev')\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nThe distribution of abundances of species is one of the basic patterns of ecological communities. The empirical distributions of abundances (SADs) or their ranks (RADs) are modelled through probability distributions. Hence, the maximum likelihood method can be used to fit and compare such models. \r\n\r\n## Features\r\n - Classic SAD models: logseries, lognormal, broken-stick, ... \r\n - Classic rank-abundance models: geometric, zipf, zipf-mandelbrodt, ...\r\n - Tools for quick diagnostic and comparison of models; \r\n - Tools to simulate Poisson and negative binomial samples from abundances in communities.\r\n\r\n\r\n## More info\r\n - [Research project](http://ecologia.ib.usp.br/let/doku.php?id=engl:projects:sads) at our [Lab wiki](http://ecologia.ib.usp.br/let)\r\n - Report bugs and issues [here](https://github.com/piklprado/sads/issues). \r\n - User guide:\r\n```r\r\nvignette(topic=\"sads_intro\", package=\"sads\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
